The main goal of this project is to understand and implement spatial queries using Simba1: an Apache Spark framework extended with spatial capabilities.

Description of datasets
The first dataset (POIs.tar.gz) are Point-of-Interest (POI) locations around Beijing. The dataset was extracted from OpenStreetMap2 and it collects diverse amenities and shops around the city. It shows the identification, longitude, latitude and a brief description of each POI. The second dataset (trajectories.tar.gz) are trajectories of moving objects around Beijing. It was extracted from the GeoLife3 Project. It collects the trajectory identification, object identification, longitude, latitude and time of each measurement.

#############################
First, unzip the project folder. Then go into the project folder. Run sbt package

#############################
Second, go into the spark folder

#############################
Then
	For part1, run bin/spark-submit â€“class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.RTreeIndex [path of the compiled source code jar]
	Then you need to run ./plot.py [sparkpath/mbrs.csv] [sparkpath/points.csv]

	#############################
	For part2 query one, run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryOne [path of the compiled source code jar]. 
	For part2 query two, run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryTwo [path of the compiled source code jar].
	For part2 query three, run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryThree [path of the compiled source code jar].
	For part2 query four, run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryFour [path of the compiled source code jar].
	For part2 query five, run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryFive [path of the compiled source code jar].

	#############################
	For part3, we tried to write a wrapper on top of query 4 and query 5, but ended up with memory size issues. So we had to manually run all parameters. Steps are as follow:
	Change a combination of parameters. E.g. 100m and 4 cores
	Recompile by sbt package
	run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryFour
	run bin/spark-submit -class org.apache.spark.sql.simba.examples.queryFive
